### User Guide 

This application is made for those who are interested in the evolution of baby names in United States since 1960. It is also a convenient tool for the use of selecting names for future babies. The data source **baby-names-by-state.csv** was downloaded from the github repository of [Hadley Wickham.](https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names)

1. In the left sidebar, you could pick **_one_** name in the drop down name-list. If the list seems too long, you may write down the letters with your keyboard, then the available revelant results will display.
2. In addition, a specific range of years could be defined for your convenience. 
3. **_One or more_** states may be chosen by your preference. A **_Select All_** buttion have been placed at the end of sidebar in case that you would like to select all of them. The backspace key on your keyboard could be used to delete when you are no longer interested in your previous choices.
